- 2024-05-29 at32f405 cpu soldered by hand
- 2024-06-01 [openocd](https://github.com/ArteryTek/openocd) from ArteryTek works. ```openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/at32f402xx.cfg```
- 2024-06-02 patch for [black magic probe](https://github.com/koendv/blackmagic-firmware/blob/master/at32f405.patch) to support at32f405. Download firmware to at32f405 works.
- 2024-06-04 copied rt-thread _at32f405-start_ project. Replaced _system_clock_config_ with one generated by AT32 Work Bench. Verified 32.768kHz and 12 MHz crystal frequency.
- 2024-06-13 i2c-based devices checked. the cst816t capacitive touch panel works. the ds3231 real-time clock works. at system start-up, the at32f405 clock is now set to the same time as the ds3231 clock. i2c connector pinout was reversed; fixed.
- 2024-06-23 sd card works.
- 2024-06-30 qspi flash xip "execute-in-place" works. Writing to qspi flash using the serial console "ymodem" works, but is slow. Need a bootloader for qspi flash.
